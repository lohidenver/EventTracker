# EventTracker

This is a basic crud/curd project where the crud/curd takes place on the front end.  I originally was planning to do a major project with this with Garbage Pail Kids as the theme, but I ended up having a migraine so I changed it to migraines.  I plan on doing a big GPK project soon.

# Lessons Learned
* Creating a SQL database with MySQLWorkbench.
* Mapping an entity to a SQL table.
* Using JUnit tests to test if mapping is correct.
* Using Postman
* Creating basic front end crud/curd operations.

# Problems
When I went to recreate my project I had problems with running my program because I kept getting an access denied with my database because I changed it.
