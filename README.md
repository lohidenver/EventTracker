# EventTracker


This is a basic crud/curd project where the crud/curd takes place on the front end.  I originally was planning to do a major project with this with Garbage Pail Kids as the theme, but I ended up having a migraine so I changed it to migraines.  I plan on doing a big GPK project soon.

Lessons Learned
Creating a SQL database with MySQLWorkbench.
Mapping an entity to a SQL table.
Using JUnit tests to test if mapping is correct.
Creating basic front end crud/curd operations.
